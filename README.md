git clone https://github.com/coderSagnikDS/google-play-app-review-sentiment-analyser.git
cd google-play-sentiment-analyzer
```
### 2. Set up Python environment
Make sure you have latest Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Set up Ngrok (optional for local public access)
Create an account at https://ngrok.com/ and get your auth token.
In your Python code (before starting the app), add:
```bash
from pyngrok import ngrok
ngrok.set_auth_token("your_token_here")
```
### 4. Run the Flask app
```bash
python app.ipynb
```

Your app will start at http://localhost:5000 and also provide a public ngrok URL.
Copy the public URL and paste it in Line 100 in my html code
(Update in progress to fix this)
